									<h2>Developing Cybersecurity Recommendations</h2>
									<p>For business leaders, quantifying cyber risk allows risk managers in other parts of the enterprise to roll that risk up into the enterprise-wide risk tolerance.</p>

								<p>This report focuses on how cybersecurity teams can analyze user behavior to detect potentially suspicious patterns, that can become a Cybersecurity Risk. Cybersecurity risk is defined as insecurity of information or technology and relates to the loss of data control, integrity, and confidentiality of information systems. As well as considers the adverse implications of such actions to organizations, companies, and government operations (Editor, 2022).</p>
								<p>The term vulnerability is defined as the weakness in a system’s security network that causes unauthorized access when triggered by a threat source (CSRC, 2022) (Reciprocity, 2022). A summary of the main cybersecurity threats and corresponding definitions is presented in Table 1, (European, 2022).</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/BAN-709-Table-001.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Table 1 summarizes threats by category without fully developing each of them. For example, the Malware category can be subdivided into Viruses, Worms, Trojan, Spyware, Adware, Ransomware, and Fileless malware (Cisco, 2022).</p>
								<p>Organizations looking to detect potentially suspicious patterns can use User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) to detect users’ suspicious activities and anomalies (Palo, 2022). Table 2 presents a list of where user data can be collected within an organization’s IT network (Lord, 2018).</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/BAN-709-Table-002.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Microsoft provides a service called Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps as a part of its Microsoft 365 Defender. This service helps to detect user suspicious behavior by providing a user-friendly guide to configure Built-In anomaly detection policies that are preconfigured for common security use cases (Curwin, 2022).</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/BAN-709-Table-003.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>The cybersecurity risk can be calculated using the following formula, (Tunggal, 2022):</p>
								<p><b><i>Cyber Risk = Threat X Vulnerability X InformationValue</i></b></p>
								<p>The Return on Investment (ROI) is calculated as follows (ENISA, 2012):</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/BAN-709-Fig-001.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>The definition and concept of Return on Security Investment (ROSI) influence the investment made to ensure a company or organization is safe against cybersecurity threats. By investing in cybersecurity, a company won’t produce a profit. The main benefit will be a reduction or mitigation of cybersecurity risks. A cybersecurity investment will provide a loss reduction (ENISA, 2012).</p>
								<p><b>Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)</b> = Amount of money expected to be lost when a threat event occurs.</p>
								<p><b>Annual Rate of Occurrence (ARO)</b> = Probability that a threat event occurs in one year.</p>
								<p><b>Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE)</b> = Annual monetary loss from a threat event in a specific asset.</p>
								<p><b>ALE = ARO * SLE</b></p>							
								<p>The Return on Security Investmet (ROSI) is defined as below (ENISA, 2012):</p>
