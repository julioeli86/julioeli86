									<h2>Equifax Data Breach (FTC Case)</h2>
								</header>
								<p>During Q1 2017 Equifax experienced a cyberattack that compromised hundreds of millions of United States customers. The attack occurred due to known vulnerabilities of Equifax systems (Fruhlinger, 2020). Equifax’s data security system was not able to stop the first breach on their security system due to several issues with the Equifax Security system as 1.- poor server architecture design, 2.- systems with expired encryption certificates, and 3.- outdated Apache Struts patches in Equifax’ Systems. Once inside, the attackers stole 143 million of Equifax’s consumers’ data profiles. (Fruhlinger, 2020). The data breach caused a settlement of 575 million and a loss of consumer confidence in the Equifax brand, (Fair, 2019).</p>

								<p>I was surprised by the main reasons that caused the Equifax data breach event. I was one of the people affected by this incident and was unaware of the root causes that led to this incident. My credit score or identity was not as compromised as other people however It is concerning that the data information systems of an S&P 500 company became compromised due to a sequence of unfortunate human errors. Could Artificial Intelligence help us to solve this type of issue in the future? When the human interaction on the installation of new patches to computer software be removed from the equation? We cannot answer these questions now; however, Companies like Equifax need to trust their standard work procedures to manage the risk of data security breaches.</p>
								<p>Reading about the Equifax data breach event helped me to understand a very important concept about data security. A company could buy, create, or design the most secure data system; however, it will always have to count on human error to be able to disrupt that system. Processes and work procedures play an important role to keep the system working. A system that complies with the defined standard work procedures mitigates the risk of events that the one that Equifax experienced during Q1 2017.</p>
