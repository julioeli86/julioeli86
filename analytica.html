									<h2>Cambridge Analytica (FTC Case)</h2>
									<p>Cambridge Analytica, a data-science consultancy, and marketing agency as described by itself learned that Facebook’s user’s data could provide insight into how a certain person could vote.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Analytica-002.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Cambridge Analytica used Facebook Graph API to gain access from Facebook’s users and their friends. Cambridge Analytica used a Facebook App to gain access to at least 250,000 Facebook users’ personal information and other information from up to 65 million friends of the original Facebook users. According to the FTC, Cambridge Analytica misleads the Facebook App users about the type of data they were collecting from the users. In addition, Cambridge Analytica did not get permission from the friends of the original users to get their data. (Holleran, 2020)</p>

								<p>By learning about the Cambridge Analytica and Facebook case, I was able to understand a very important matter concerning data security and privacy. The number of regulations or laws put in place by any government to mitigate the risk of customers' data being used without their approval will always have a risk of not being followed by specific companies. Cambridge Analytica knew about the privacy laws and the limitation of the Facebook App API however it chose not to follow the law. Therefore, the FTC issued a unanimous Opinion and Final Order due to Cambridge Analytica engaging in deceptive practices in its relationship between the GSRApp and its users. (Trade, 2019)</p>
								<p>I learned about the powerful tool that a website API could become when used against policy and laws. In addition, I gain interest in learning more about API and how it can help me to successfully achieve some personal goals and projects. Also, I was introduced to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and how this certification allows websites and apps to seemly transfer data from European Union countries to the United States and vice versa.</p>
